Predictive modeling using both traditional and cutting-edge machine learning techniques for the real estate industry that covers the following topics:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Dive deep into datasets to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies.
- **Descriptive Statistics:** Understand the current state of real estate markets through detailed statistical analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Address key real estate problems with a focus on investment opportunities, particularly tailored to small investors. These models leverage both traditional statistics and modern machine learning algorithms to predict market trends and investment outcomes.
