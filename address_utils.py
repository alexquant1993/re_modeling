    """
    Correct the spelling of a street name based on a dictionary of misspellings.

    This function takes a street name and a dictionary of misspellings and corrections.
    It replaces any misspelled words or phrases in the street name with the correct
    spelling.
    The function handles multi-word misspellings and ensures that the longest matches are
    replaced first.

    Parameters:
    - street_name (str): The street name to correct.
    - misspellings (dict): A dictionary where the keys are misspelled words or phrases
        and the values are the correct spellings.

    Returns:
